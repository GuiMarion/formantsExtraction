# formantsExtraction
This project allows you to extract each formants over time from arbitrary wave file (Python + Matlab).

It uses [parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) which is a cython version of Praat allowing to use any Praat function in a pythonic envoronement. This project propose a Python version and a Matlab version of the functions. 

## Get Started
### Python
To install the dependencies for Python use (we assume python is linking to your default python environement), please use our script:
    sh install_py.sh

### Matlab
To install the dependencies for Matlab use please use our script:
    matlab install.m

## Functions
    
   * getFormants(filename (string) ): Returns the formants as a matrix (formants * time (ms))
   * getRangeFormants(filename (string), formant (int)): Returns the range (min, max) of a given formant.
   * getMeanFormants(filename (string), formant (int)): Returns the average frequency of a given formant.
    
Please refer to main_formantsExtraction.m and main_formantsExtraction.py for examples use of these functions.
